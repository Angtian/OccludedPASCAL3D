# OccludedPASCAL3D+
The OccludedPASCAL3D+ is a dataset design for evaluate robustness of algorithms for detection, keypoint detection and pose estimation. 
The OccludedPASCAL3D+ is built via superimpose occluder cropped from MSCOCO dataset to PASCAL3D+ dataset. Specifically, we only use ImageNet subset in PASCAL3D+, which have 10812 testing images.
